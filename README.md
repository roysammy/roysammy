    Parking on college campuses is often difficult due to limited spaces and high vehicle volume, causing frustration for students, staff, and visitors. The lack of an efficient monitoring system leads to poor space utilization and congestion. This aims to address this by developing a smart parking system that accurately tracks each vehicle’s spot, enables real-time monitoring, and generates actionable insights from parking data.
