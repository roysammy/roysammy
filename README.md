**Hi, I'm Soumyajit.**  
I am currently working as a **Data Scientist at [Pine Labs ↗](https://www.pinelabs.com/)**, one of the largest fintech companies in Asia.  
I love reading about the latest developments in **Machine Learning**, particularly **NLP** and **post-training of LLMs**.  
I have published some work on **computer vision**, which you can find below

### Publications

### Blog
- [Coming up with a solution for Vehicle Movement Analysis and Insight Generation in a College Campus ↗](https://medium.com/@roysoumyajit/coming-up-with-a-solution-for-vehicle-movement-analysis-and-insight-generation-in-a-college-campus-b76aa7e84de0)  
  Parking on college campuses is often difficult due to limited spaces and high vehicle volume, causing frustration for students, staff, and visitors. The lack of an efficient monitoring system leads to poor space utilisation and congestion. This aims to address these challenges by developing a **smart parking system** that tracks each vehicle’s spot, enables real-time monitoring, and generates actionable insights from parking data.
